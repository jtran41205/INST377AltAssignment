Everything in between the <html> </html> is a single "element"
inside them are a head element and body element

The head contains information about the HTML that the user does not see,
but the body does

Took me a while to figure out that different heading elements actually matter
h1 to h6, prominence in descending order

List elements (ul or ol) should only contain a "li" element
However, a "li" element is able to contain a "p" element just fine
