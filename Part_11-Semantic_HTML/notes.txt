Semantic HTML.
Remember that search engines care about HTML, the "what" of the website

CSS is the "how it looks" and does not affect search results

this is when we use other elements instead of divs
This allows search engines to tell what is on the page outside of a bunch of div elements

after a sea of divs, we now give these things meaning!
