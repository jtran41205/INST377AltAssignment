Yea I totally used the anchors learned in this chapter in order to go back
to the previous one to properly add links to my references section

Anchors can be used to add links, but that's not its primary purpose, and Anchors
don't actually do anything on their own. This is what the href is for

I'll be honest, atom letting me autofill elements makes understanding a bit more difficult, but I love pressing tab
and making text magically appear. This is how I learned about the use of href="#", which jumps you to the top of the page.

an absolute link would be me making a link to the internetingishard tutorials

Relative links assume you are within the same domain, so it's as simple as setting the href to the filepath
I'll start trying root-relative links when I start to experiment with using a server.

I have no idea how I missed the "target" attribute before but hey I have it now!

avoid spaces. Use hyphens and underscores.


the characters '<' '>' and '&' are reserved characters.
They are used for writing elements and entities.
There are also other entities for quotes. Very important since quotes are used for other coding purposes
