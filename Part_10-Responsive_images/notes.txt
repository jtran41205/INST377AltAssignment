right. Images and dimensions. Pain. Real Pain
As you can see, Prof A, I am getting delirious at this point
please don't let my waning sanity reflect on my real ability to learn

Remember back when we talked about SVGs being vector images??
yea that's how we solve the issue of different sizes for different devices having different resolutions
TECHNOLOGY!

Unfortunately, not everything is an SVG. We have a bunch of PNGs, GIFs, and JPGs
These are defined by pixels instead of vectors.

Responsive Image Optimization

Different devices have different image requirements. Fortunately, HTML provides a way to choose the best image for the user’s device. Over the next few sections, we’ll take a look at three scenarios for optimizing responsive images:

    A standard-resolution screen that doesn’t need a retina-quality image.
    A retina mobile device that can use a standard-quality image because it’s been scaled down so much.
    A desktop layout that uses a wide image, and an associated mobile layout that uses a taller image.

Testing With Chrome

This technique works just fine in Chrome,
but we can’t really tell because it’s being clever.
 Chrome will always use the high-res version if it has already been cached locally,
  which means we can’t see the low-res version by simply making the browser window narrow.
   We have to avoid the local browser cache by opening a new incognito window,
    then avoid loading photo-big.jpg by making the window very narrow before loading the page.

  I do this in firefox so I would never have noticed this
