I have no idea why comments in css and html have to be different,
but I love that css comments use the normal convention of /* this */

I forgot that I can leave comments in code, so I'll probably be doing this notes
bit in the code more often. I will still keep using these, however.
Might be useful to keep around for notes that don't work in comments

remember that HTML is for WHAT is on the page
CSS determines how it's presented


CASCADE HIERARCHY:

    The browser’s default stylesheet
    User-defined stylesheets
    External stylesheets (that’s us)
    Page-specific styles (that’s also us)
    Inline styles (that could be us, but it never should be)

this is important to learn if you want page specific styles.


Just like how a single css sheet can be used for multiple pages,
a single page can use multiple css sheets. This is covered later in responsive
design. Basically, phones require us to do more work to accomodate them.
