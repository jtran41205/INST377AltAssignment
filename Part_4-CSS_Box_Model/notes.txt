I'm at work and feeling delirious as I am typing this so forgive me.

Now we learn the box model, which helps is determine an entire page layout.
padding, borders, margins, block boxes, and inline boxes

block elements definte the structure of the html
inline elements are ways to customize the stuff
inside of a block element

default box behavior:
    -block boxes are always below the previous block element
    -this is how html normally flows
    -width of block boxes is based on your browser window customize
    -the default height is based on the amount of content
    -inline boxes do NOT affect vertical spacing.
    -inline box width is based on its own content.

CSS can override these behaviors
for example, you give have an "em" or "strong" display:block
and it will be displayed like its own block element
this is just an example, don't do this

CSS box model:
    Content – The text, image, or other media content in the element.
    Padding – The space between the box’s content and its border.
    Border – The line between the box’s padding and margin.
    Margin – The space between the box and surrounding boxes.
this bit is not defined by HTML, it's presentational stuff done by CSS

remember that em units can be used for padding since they
scale with font size
there are different formats to use padding. one is easier to read, the other
is easier to type
padding order is top, left, bottom, right (clockwise)

border creation: size then style then color

"Borders are common design elements,
but they’re also invaluable for debugging.
When you’re not sure how a box is being rendered,
add a border: 1px solid red; declaration to it."
I will cherish this advice.

Differences between padding and margins:
    - The padding of a box has a background, while margins are always transparent.
    - Padding is included in the click area of an element, while margins aren’t.
    - Margins collapse vertically, while padding doesn’t (we’ll discuss this more in the next section).


Yes I copy pasted a few things, because I don't like rewording good notes
