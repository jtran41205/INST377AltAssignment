Incomplete work for Prof A

I'm going to work on a bunch of tutorials from https://www.internetingishard.com
and demonstrate my understanding of web development.
I'll use this readme to explain the various folders

Parts 1-13: I go through the various tutorials, demonstrate that I have followed them,
and write notes to show things I have learned about it.

Project Final: This is where I will work on a final full project to try and show that
I learned something from this class
