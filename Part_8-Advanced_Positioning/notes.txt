So far we've been working with Static Flow, but there are other types of positioning as well

  Relative
  Absolute
  Fixed

we'll be going over these 3 in their own sections

-------------------------
The CSS position property lets you alter the positioning scheme of a particular element.
Its default value, as you might imagine, is static.
 When an element’s position property doesn’t have a value of static,
 it’s called a “positioned element”.
 Positioned elements are what this entire chapter is about.

 you can do a bunch of positioning rules on each other
-------------------------
Relative

moves elements around *relative* to where they'd be on a page.
For example, you can position an element to always be a certain distance from
where its original position would be

------------------------
Absolute

similar to relative positioning, but this time, it is relative to the
entire browser window instead of its original position

Absolute positioning becomes more practical when it's relative to something that
is in the static flow of the page.
therefore: (relatively) absolute position

-----------------------
Fixed

Fixed is a bit like absolute, except it breaks from normal flow and is always
on screen regardless of where you scroll on the page. Useful for navigation bars

-----------------------
 creating that menu page

z-index for putting things in front/behind of others
wow! 3 whole dimensions!
