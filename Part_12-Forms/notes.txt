my sanity is frayed, I had a Karen interaction at work as I am typing this


Creating forms, the final form,,,, of responsive design? at the very least, it's
extra important here.

Have a mockup before you start writing code

use <div> as a container for <label> and <input> elements

<input> elements are used to actually get information from the user
<label> inputs are like another semantic HTML element but used for form labels

<div class='form-row'>
  <label for='full-name'>Name</label>
  <input id='full-name' name='full-name' type='text'/>
</div>
<input> here creates a text field, as we see in type='text'


WOW when I do the email example, my browser recognizes it as an email field and
asks to autofill it as such!

Also note the placeholder attribute of <input> for the email. It's great for
telling the user what they should input.
