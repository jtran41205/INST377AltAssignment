Responsive design is how we can make a webpage look good regardless of if
it is on mobile, tablet, or desktop
This is done through media queries. These allow us to apply CSS rules only under specific conditions

Remember that HTML is what shows up on google and CSS is how it looks to humans.

Media queries always begin with the @media “at-rule”
followed by some kind of conditional statement, and then some curly braces.
 Inside the curly braces, you put a bunch of ordinary CSS rules.
 The browser only pays attention to those rules if the condition is met.

Fluid layout:
one that stretches based on the screen width
Different phones have different sizes. work with this

fixed width layout:
one that keeps its length regardless of screen dimensions

there are CSS styles that we want to apply to EVERY layout, so those are outside of
the @media only screen and (whatever) sections

----
Mobile first development is when you design a webpage to look good on mobile devices first

-----
Create base styles outside the media queries. The media queries will overwrite
anything we need to. This is easier and intuitive and there is no reason why I should explain that
----------
Believe it or not, that’s actually all you need to know to create responsive websites. If we boil it down, we’re really only concerned with three things:

    The responsive design (the mockups for each layout)
    CSS rules for implementing each of those layouts
    Media queries for conditionally applying those CSS rules
