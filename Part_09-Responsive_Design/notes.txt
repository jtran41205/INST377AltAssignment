Responsive design is how we can make a webpage look good regardless of if
it is on mobile, tablet, or desktop
This is done through media queries. These allow us to apply CSS rules only under specific conditions

Remember that HTML is what shows up on google and CSS is how it looks to humans.

Media queries always begin with the @media “at-rule”
followed by some kind of conditional statement, and then some curly braces.
 Inside the curly braces, you put a bunch of ordinary CSS rules.
 The browser only pays attention to those rules if the condition is met.

Fluid layout:
one that stretches based on the screen width

fixed width layout:
one that keeps its length regardless of screen dimensions
